incase you get an error like " Failed conversion of utf8 string:  Dz " then please, use vsc or ntpd++, or really any that allows to change encoding
and set the encoding of the files to their supposed format.

it works for me atm, however it might not work for you.

if it doesnt happen then you dont need to do anything. :3
